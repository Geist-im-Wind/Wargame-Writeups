I decided to start with the most solved crypto challenge to see how much trouble these were likely to give me.

The Challenge:
```
What is the next number in this sequence?

1 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 10 - 12 - 16 - 18 - 22 - 28 - 30 - 36 - 40 - ?
```

My first inclination is to see how the numbers increment and find any possible patterns. In order, the increments are:

`1 - 2 - 2 - 4 - 2 - 4 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 2 - 6 - 4 - ?`

Nothing there. This must mean it has to do with something with the numbers themselves.

I won't lie, I sat here staring at them for a good half hour before the I started to notice that the sort of pattern of increase they have reminded me of prime numbers. Sure enough, each one was right before a prime number.

This means that, since the next prime number is 43, the next integer in the set is 42.
