I need to find the next number in the following sequence:

```
  (5)  (10) (10) (20) (10) (20) (10) (20)
10 - 15 - 25 - 35 - 55 - 65 - 85 - 95 - 115 - ? - ?
```

This one was made easier by knowing that the first number sequence puzzle used prime numbers. Looking for a relation to prime numbers, I found that these are a list of them multiplied by 5, which made solving the actual puzzle easy.

The next two primes are 29 and 31, which just need to be multiplied by 5.
