NOT COMPLETE

Level Goal: "Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it."

Looking at the helpful commands list, I have a pretty good idea about what the challenge will be here.

Initially I tried logging in to bandit26 using the provided key (`ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost`), but I was immediately disconnected with an ASCII art of "bandit26" at the bottom.

This led me to do some searching on how to identify the shell being used by a given user. At first, I tried using `finger`, but I found it was not installed. Looking for an alternative approach, I found `getent passwd | awk -F: -v user="bandit26" '$1 == user {print $NF}'`. I will be honest and say I had no idea how this worked when I found it, so I decided to read the manuals to get an idea of which each command here was doing.

`getent passwd` takes the database of entries in passwd and lists it. Passwd itself is basically a database of information about users that can log into the system.

`awk -F: -v user="bandit26" '$1 == user {print $NF}'` uses `fs` for the input field separator (`-F`). This separates the input record into fields. It then creates a variable named 'user' containing the word "bandit26" (`-v user="bandit26"`) and defines the first positional argument as this variable before printing it's results `'$1 == user {print $NF}'`. It struck me in reading this that this command is a bit strange, as doing just `getent passwd | awk -F: '$1 == "bandit26" {print $NF}'` works all the same.

Anyway, this returns /usr/bin/showtext as the shell. In reading it, it contains the following:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

Now that we know what is being run immediately, we can try to figure out a way to break out of it. In running `ls -l /usr/bin/showtext`, we can see that the owner is root, so we are unable to edit it directly.

My first attempt was to try running this:
```bash
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost /bin/bash -s << EOF
<random commands here>
EOF
```

This only ended up echoing the commands before the ASCII art and exit and no more.
