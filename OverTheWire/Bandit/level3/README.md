Since they seem to be teaching basic Linux commands, I do another `ls -la`, find a folder named 'inhere', `cd` into it, then run `ls -la` again, and find a file named '.hidden'. Using the dot, normally it would not be shown, but thanks to `-a`, it is.

From here, I just run `cat .hidden` and get the password.
