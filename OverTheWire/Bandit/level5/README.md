Going into this one, I found a similar set up to the previous level, but with multiple sub-folders beneath the "inhere" folder. Thinking it simply wanted me to do a recursive search, I ran my `grep -PvR "[\x80-\xFF]" ./*` command once more, this time with the `-R` to do a recursive search. This, however, proved fruitless when I got a dozen or so results. This got me thinking about how else I might be able to distinguish the password from the junk.

I soon realized many of the files were long, and I saw none shorter than 32 characters, which is what the previous passwords had been. So I ran a recursive regex search for exactly 32 character words.

This led to me to run `grep -owR '\w\{32,32\}' ./*`. `-o` tells it to only print words that match, `-w` tells it to only match whole words, and `-R` tells it to do a recursive search starting at the location "./*", which is simply the folder in which the command is being run and all sub-folders. The regex `\w\{32, 32\}` tells the command I am looking for only words with exactly 32 characters.

This led me to ./maybehere07/.file2, which contained the password.
