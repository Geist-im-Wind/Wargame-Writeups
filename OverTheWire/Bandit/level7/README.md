The Level Goal for this one sounds easy enough:

"The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth"

I just used `grep 'millionth' data.txt` and found the password next to it. I can't help but feel there was a far more complicated way to have done this with the other commands, but I see no reason to for now.
