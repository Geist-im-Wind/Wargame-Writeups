# WARNING: IF YOU HAVE NOT SOLVED THESE WARGAMES, PLEASE DO NOT READ WRITEUPS. IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.

This is a repo for me to host wargame writeups, mostly so I can go back and see my own thought process and how I might improve.

## To-do
* Add writeups for Natas levels I did before start of repo.
* Begin pwnable.kr writeups.
* Finish Natas, then Krypton, then Narnia.
